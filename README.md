--------------------------
As a part of Implementing my learning on Neural Networks, I have created this repository. 

The purpose of the CNN notebook is to do a basic image classification task, using Convolutional Neural Networks. 

The architecture is
 - 4 layers of convolutions 
 - each layer followed by batch Normalization & pooling. 
 
To train the model on custom images place the images folder in the folder repository folder containing script file(RustNet.py/Rustnet.ipynb).

To Test the trained model on test images, put the test images folder in the same folder as Predictor.py/Predictor.ipynb
